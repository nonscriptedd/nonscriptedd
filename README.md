- 👋 Hello! I am NonScriptedd_ (or just Scriptedd_). I am normally a web developer, but i of course look at other languages like Python or C++ (Because i am also interested in other stuff!). Also i like Graphic Designing (GIMP)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development tho!
- 💞️ I do not think i can join big projects yet. I am still learning. Besides, who would even post their website on GitHub (Except if it is a starter-pack a-like)? OK, maybe i will.
- Just call me he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a twin who does python development for data engineering. Check out his profile here:
