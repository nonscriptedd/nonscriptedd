- 👋 Hello! I am NonScriptedd_ (or just Scriptedd_). I am normally a web developer, but i of course look at other languages like C or Rust (Because i am also interested in operating systems and low level components.). Also i like Graphic Designing (Gimp 3)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development tho!
- 💞️ I do not think i can collabrate at big projects yet. I am still learning. Besides, who would even post their website on GitHub (Except if it is a starter-pack a-like)?
- Just call me he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I DESTROYED my computer trying to install arch linux... But it was fixed! :)
